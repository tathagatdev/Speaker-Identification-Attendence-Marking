It uses popular ML technique GMM to train speaker identification models.

Data-set:

Training corpus : It has been developed from audios taken from 'on-line VoxForge speech database' and consists of 5 speech       utterances for each speaker, spoken by 34 speakers (i.e, 20-30 seconds/speaker).

Test corpus: This consists of remaining 5 unseen utterances of the same 34 speakers taken in train corpus. All audio files are of 3-5 seconds duration and are sampled at 16000 Hz.

The documentation/tutorial for task in this repository can be read from this blog.
